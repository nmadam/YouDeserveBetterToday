# YouDeserveBetterToday

This repository is for the Individual Project for Enterprise Java Spring 2016

### Problem Statement

Create a website application for my friend to promote the new book she is writing, "You Deserve Better" under the pseudoname CJ Laclove.
This website will contain a home page with a link to a form for the user to input their contact information with emphasis on 
email addresses. This data will be stored in a MySql database. The application will generate a "welcome" email to the new user.

This application will also include a link to Amazon for user to purchase the new book. I would like to capture information of customers
buying this book from Amazon, particularly the customer's email address if Amazon will allow this. I would also like to link 
this information to the applications database to add the new customer's information if it does not already exist. This 
database will include a column which can indicate if the book was purchased.

This website application also has the potential to include a blog and/or discussion board.
